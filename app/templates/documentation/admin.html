                                is where setup data can be entered.</p>
                            <img class="img-thumbnail" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/admin-home.png') }}"/>

                            <p>The <b>Users</b> tab lists the users that have been created. The admin controls all the
                                accounts, creating new users and changing passwords via this interface.
                                For users that log in via the Android app, a numerical password must be used.</p>

                            <p>The <b>Schedules</b> tab controls the planned production time of your equipment. A
                                schedule is assigned to each machine, allowing multiple to be changed at once. Planned
                                production time is used to calculate availability in the OEE calculation. These
                                schedules are computed at midnight each day, so changing a schedule will not affect any
                                calculations in the past. </p>

                            <p>The <b>Machines</b> tab lists the equipment that has been created. Selecting one
                                allows it to be edited, or click "Create" to add another. Each piece of equipment can be
                                assigned an Android tablet for data collection. The tablets should be given a static IP,
                                which can be entered in this screen to pair the tablet to the machine.
                                Workflow types, once created, allow different flows of work on Android tablets, for
                                example some workflows may request a reason for excessive downtime from the operator.
                                Once created, equipment cannot be
                                removed. De-select "Active" if it is no longer needed. </p>

                            <p>The <b>Machine Groups</b> tab allows machines to be categorised into groups, which
                                helps during visualisation </p>

                            <p>The <b>Activity Codes</b> tab allows editing of the status codes of the equipment.
                                The first 4 will always represent No User, Up, Down, Setting. The names and colours of
                                these can be tweaked but do not use these codes for any other purpose. New codes can be
                                added for any purpose. The colour selected here will be reflected in visualisation and
                                on the paired Android tablet. Once created, codes cannot be removed. De-select "Active"
                                if it is no longer needed. </p>

                            <p>For additional config options, such as database credentials and running in demonstration
                                mode, the file <kbd>config.py</kbd> can be edited in the install folder of this server
                            </p>
