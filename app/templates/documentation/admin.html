                                The admin tab</a>
                                is where setup data can be entered.</p>
                            <img class="img-thumbnail" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/admin-home.png') }}"/>

                            <p>The <b>Users</b> tab lists the users that have been created. The admin controls all the
                                accounts, creating new users and changing passwords via this interface.
                                For users that log in via the Android app, a numerical password must be used.</p>

                            <p>The <b>Shifts</b> tab controls the planned production time of your equipment.
                                This allows the system to distinguish between planned downtime and unplanned downtime.
                                When a shift starts, the system will change all "down" machines from planned to
                                unplanned downtime and vice versa when the shift ends. If you have a more complex shift
                                pattern (e.g. 2 shifts in one day or a shift that continues past midnight) the shift can
                                be modified manually by accessing the "shift_period" table in the database</p>

                            <p>The <b>Tablets</b> tab lists the tablets that have been connected to the server. Once a
                                tablet is discovered, it can be assigned to a machine here.

                            </p>

                            <p>The <b>Machines</b> tab lists the equipment that has been created. Selecting one
                                allows it to be edited, or click "Create" to add another. Workflow types allow
                                different flows of work on Android tablets, for example the "pausable" workflow allows a
                                job to be paused without immediately knowing the downtime reason.
                                Once created, equipment cannot be
                                removed. De-select "Active" if it is no longer needed. </p>

                            <p>The <b>Machine Groups</b> tab allows machines to be categorised into groups, which
                                helps during visualisation </p>

                            <p>The <b>Activity Codes</b> tab allows editing of the status codes of the equipment.
                                The first 4 will always represent No User, Up, Down, Setting. The names and colours of
                                these can be tweaked but do not use these codes for any other purpose. New codes can be
                                added for any purpose. The colour selected here will be reflected in visualisation and
                                on the paired Android tablet. Once created, codes cannot be removed. De-select "Active"
                                if it is no longer needed. </p>

                            <p>For additional config options, such as database credentials and running in demonstration
                                mode, the file <kbd>config.py</kbd> can be edited in the install folder of this server
                            </p>
